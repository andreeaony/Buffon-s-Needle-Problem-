# Buffon's Needle Problem
This project simulates Buffon's Needle problem, a probability experiment that studies the chances of a randomly dropped needle crossing parallel lines.
The probability of intersection depends on the needleâ€™s length and the angle at which it falls.

# The needle crosses the line
