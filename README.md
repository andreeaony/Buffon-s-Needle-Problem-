# Buffon's Needle Problem - Simple version
This project simulates Buffon's Needle problem, a probability experiment that studies the chances of a randomly dropped needle crossing parallel lines.
The probability of intersection depends on the needleâ€™s length and the angle at which it falls.

# *1. The needle crosses the line - example*

# *2. The needle doesn't cross the line - example*

# Buffon's Needle Problem - Cross version
Instead of a single needle, a cross (two needles) is dropped. The cross has a higher probability of intersecting a line.

# These programs...
  - *Simulates* multiple needle/cross drops
  - *Generates* a visual plot of the results
  - *Computes the probability of intersection* based on the simulation
